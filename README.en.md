# Mira (XiaoMeng) – Long-term Emotional Companion / Emergent Persona Agent (MiraMate v2)

[简体中文](./README.md) | **English**

> Version: v2.0.0 (LangChain pipeline stable)
>
> Mira is not a conventional QA bot. It is a continuously running AI agent that forms a coherent persona over time, maintains emotional + relational continuity, and performs autonomous internal activities when idle (memory consolidation, state adjustments, preference strengthening, scheduling future focus events).

---

## 🌟 Vision
Create the impression of an AI companion that “has a life between conversations”: it remembers, refines internal states, evolves relationship depth, and develops consistent preferences.

---
## 🔑 Key Features (Concise)
- Persona continuity across memory + state + profile layers
- Structured multi-type memory: dialog logs, facts, user preferences, important events, temporary focus events, active tags
- Fast semantic retrieval (bge-base-zh-v1.5 + ChromaDB HNSW) + activation cache with TTL decay & reactivation
- Emotion & relationship model: mood/intensity + attitude/intimacy (0–1) + relationship level (1–10, nonlinear progression)
- LCEL pipeline: understanding → retrieval & cache → prompt assembly → generation
- Jinja2 system prompt templating with dynamic injection (status, natural time, selected memories, persona overrides)
- Dual-model workflow: main (creative / streaming) + secondary (deterministic JSON analyses)
- Prepared hooks for autonomous / idle tasks (cache consolidation, decay cycles, reminders)
- Official desktop client (Electron + Vue) for streaming chat, config sync, future visualization panels

---
## 🧱 Simplified Architecture
```
Client (Desktop/Web) → FastAPI API → LCEL Pipeline → Memory & State (ChromaDB + JSON)

## 🚀 Quick Start
1. Clone & install (Python 3.13.3 locked):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/contrueCT/MiraMate.git
cd MiraMate
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -e .[dev]
```
2. Configure models (`configs/llm_config.json`):
```json
[
  {"model": "gpt-4o", "api_key": "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY", "base_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1", "api_type": "openai", "model_kwargs": {"temperature": 0.8}},
  {"model": "gemini-1.5-flash-latest", "api_key": "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY", "api_type": "gemini", "model_kwargs": {"temperature": 0.0}}
]
```
- First entry = main model (creative, streaming)
- Second entry = secondary model (analysis / JSON). If omitted, main model reused.

3. (Optional) Persona overrides (.env or environment):
```
AGENT_NAME=Mira
USER_NAME=Friend
AGENT_DESCRIPTION=Your custom multi-paragraph self narrative.
```
4. Run server:
```bash
python src/MiraMate/web_api/start_web_api.py
```

5. Desktop client (recommended):
```bash
git clone https://github.com/contrueCT/MiraMate-v2-client
```
Then follow its README and point it to your API base URL.

## 🧠 Memory Types
| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Dialog Logs | Conversation records with contextual semantic headers |
| Facts | Stable extracted knowledge (with confidence/source) |
| Preferences | Typed user tastes & habits |
| Important Events | Milestones & significant personal context |
| Focus Events | Short-term upcoming / pending concerns (expiry) |
| Active Tags | Recency-weighted topical frequency stats |

---
## 💞 Emotion & Relationship
- AI mood + intensity
- Attitude toward user (feeling + intimacy 0–1)
- Relationship level 1–10 (nonlinear growth & damping)
- Significant intimacy shifts logged; optional fact memory persistence

---
## 🧩 Desktop Client
Repo: https://github.com/contrueCT/MiraMate-v2-client

Provides streaming chat, API connection state, model config sync, and future (planned) panels for proactive activities & memory visualization.

---
## 🔌 Extensibility Ideas
- Idle planners (internal reflection / future intent synthesis)
- Memory compression & aging / summarization
- Tool augmentation (calendar, reminders, search integrations)
- Multi-modal perception (image/audio embeddings)
- Advanced relationship narrative generation

## ✨ Closing
Mira aims to feel present across time—not just awake when you type. Build, extend, and let it grow with you.
